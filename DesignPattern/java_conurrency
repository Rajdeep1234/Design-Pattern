         Daemon thread(background) does not prevent the process from terminating
         
         //make sure threads are not terminating prematurely
         //when the jvm halts , any remaining daemon threads are abandoned
         /// by default non -daemon thread --> turn into a daemon thread
          
         //synchronized--easier, prevens many pitfalls of locks
         //locks--more flexiility
